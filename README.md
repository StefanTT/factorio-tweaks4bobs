# factorio-tweaks4bobs
This mod contains some small tweaks and additions for bobs mods:

* This mod changes bobs robochests to have 4 charging points - like the vanilla roboport.
  The charging rates remain unchanged. This is done because bobs robochests have only one
  charging point. The vanilla roboport has four. The problem is that the drones in 
  Factorio do not prefer the charging pads for charging but instead queue at the robochest
  when they want to charge before entering the chest. 

* A small logistics zone expander is added that has a logistic range of 10 and no construction
  range. This expander can be used to create pathways for logistics drones.
