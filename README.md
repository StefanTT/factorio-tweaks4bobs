# factorio-tweaks4bobs
This mod contains some small tweaks and additions for bobs mods:

* The robochest is changed to have 4 charging points instead of one. The drones
  in Factorio do not prefer the charging pads and tend to queue in front of the
  robochests instead. With this tweak 4 are loaded in parallel like the vanilla
  robobort does.

* A small logistics zone expander is added that has a logistic range of 10 and
  no construction range. This expander can be used to create pathways for
  logistics drones.
